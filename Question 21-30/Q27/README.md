# Problem

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the `k` most frequent elements.

# Example

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

```Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

You may assume `k` is always valid.

# Complexity

Complexity should be less than `O(n log n)` where `n` is the size of the array.
